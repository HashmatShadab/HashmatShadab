I am Hashmat Shadab from Kashmir, currently pursuing a PhD at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence [(MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) in Abu Dhabi, UAE, where I am affiliated with the [IVAL](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/) lab. I previously completed my master's degree in Computer Vision at the same university.

- ðŸ”­ My research focuses on **Safety and Reliability of AI**, with a particular emphasis on understanding, evaluating, and enhancing the robustness of  vision-based models.
